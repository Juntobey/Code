    <h3> Cooking instructions</h3>

    <li>In a blender, pur√©e 2 onion halves, 1/2 cup (120ml) chicken stock, 3 garlic cloves, 1/2 ounce ginger, and tomato paste.<br> In a Dutch oven, combine chicken legs with pur√©e, remaining onion halves, remaining 1/2 ounce ginger, and remaining 2 cloves garlic, along with hot pepper and bay leaves.<br> Toss to coat.</li><br>
    <li>Set Dutch oven over medium heat and bring to a simmer, then cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until halved onion is soft and translucent, about 20 minutes.<br> Add an extra 1/2 cup (120ml) chicken stock if mixture begins to stick to the bottom of the pot.</li><br>
    <li> Transfer chunks of onion, ginger, garlic cloves, and hot pepper to blender.<br> Add peanut butter, canned tomatoes and their juices, and remaining 1 1/2 cups (360ml) chicken stock and pur√©e until smooth.<br> Pass blended mix through a fine-mesh strainer into the Dutch oven, stirring to incorporate.</li><br>
    <li>Increase heat to medium and bring to a simmer, then lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is tender, oils have surfaced, and mixture has thickened and reduced by about one-third, about 40 minutes.<br> Add smoked fish, reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook an additional 5 minutes. (If omitting the smoked fish, you can skip this 5-minute covered-cooking step.)<br> Remove and discard smoked fish and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve hot over white rice or fufu.</li>
